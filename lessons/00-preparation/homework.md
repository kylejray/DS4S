# Assignment

1. We expect that participants have a computer with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) on which they have administrative privileges. They should have a few specific software packages installed which are specified here (Links to an external site.). Also at this web site you will find a tentative schedule for the course.
2. Participants should be able to use this computer to video conference. I expect we will be using Zoom, but we might also switch to a service built into Canvas.  You must be able to view video and share your screen. Ideally you can share video of yourself as well. But don't stress out if you can't; you'll be OK.  If you want to practice with me ahead of time, send me an email. 
3. We also expect that, by the time of our first class, if not already, you will be  be familiar with the majority of the concepts presented in Chapters 2-4 of the required textbook (see syllabus). If you are not and still want to take the class, please work through these chapters now, before the start of the Spring Quarter.
